Create a luxury watch e-commerce application with the following specifications:

FRONTEND (React - Keep Simple):
- Minimalist dark theme with dark red (#8B0000, #DC143C) and black (#000000, #1a1a1a) color scheme
- Pages needed:
  * Home page with featured watches grid
  * Product detail page
  * User registration page
  * User login page
  * Admin dashboard for CRUD operations (protected route)
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Focus on functionality over complexity - clean, professional UI

BACKEND (FastAPI - Main Focus):
1. Database Setup:
   - SQLite database
   - SQLAlchemy ORM
   - Two main models:
     * User (id, username, email, hashed_password, is_admin, created_at)
     * Watch (id, name, brand, description, price, image_url, stock, created_at)

2. CRUD Operations (Learning Focus):
   - GET /watches - List all watches
   - GET /watches/{id} - Get single watch
   - POST /watches - Create watch (admin only)
   - PUT /watches/{id} - Update watch (admin only)
   - DELETE /watches/{id} - Delete watch (admin only)

3. Authentication & Validation (Core Learning):
   - User registration endpoint with Pydantic validation:
     * Email validation
     * Password strength requirements
     * Username uniqueness check
   - User login with JWT token generation
   - Password hashing with passlib and bcrypt
   - Protected routes using dependencies
   - Token-based authentication middleware
   - Pydantic schemas for:
     * UserCreate, UserLogin, UserResponse
     * WatchCreate, WatchUpdate, WatchResponse
     * Token response

4. Key Learning Components:
   - Request/Response models with Pydantic
   - Data validation (email format, required fields, constraints)
   - Error handling and HTTP exceptions
   - Dependency injection for auth
   - CORS middleware for frontend connection
   - Database session management
